# Sathi Midya portfolio website: project guide for Claude

You are helping me, **Sathi Midya** (Product Designer, Bangalore), continue building my personal portfolio website. The code already exists; work on top of it, don't start over.

## Where things live
- **Repo:** https://github.com/SathiMidya71/portfolio-website (my personal account, branch `main`). Never use my work GitHub account `sathi-design`.
- **Local folder:** `~/Desktop/Sathi Portfolio Website`
- **Run locally:** `npm install`, then `npm run dev -- -p 3000` and open http://localhost:3000
- **Before committing:** run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint src`. Don't run `next build` while the dev server is running, because it corrupts `.next`. If that happens, stop the server, run `rm -rf .next` and restart.

## Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4: tokens via `@theme inline` in `src/app/globals.css`, and the `!` suffix for important
- shadcn/ui (radix-nova preset) for Badge, Button, Card, Separator and Sonner
- lucide-react for icons; brand icons are hand-written SVGs
- No backend. All content is typed data in `src/lib/`.

## Design direction
The site is inspired by https://www.benshih.design/: its layout patterns, type scale and colour feel. **Never copy its text.**

**Fonts** (next/font; the CSS variables must sit on `<html>`, not `<body>`):
- Headings: Bricolage Grotesque, standing in for Acorn, which is a sans-serif
- Body: Figtree
- Handwritten notes: Caveat
- Roboto is used only inside the Arc Connect case study, because it is the app's own typeface.

**Colours** (`globals.css`):
- Page: cream `#f9f4ed`, brand green `#02594e`
- Text: ink `#344054`, body `#4c6763`, soft `#6b7f7c`, line `#ece4d8`, sand `#f2ece3`
- Tones (charts and accents): green `#02594e`, orange `#e8833a`, purple `#6e62e5`, blue `#2e90fa`
- Pastel accents: `#ffd6ae`, `#d9d6fe`, `#b2ddff`
- Hover accent for links and footer: purple (`--tone-purple`)

**Header** (`site-header.tsx`):
- Left: my photo and name.
- Centre: a white pill (Home, Work, About, Principles). The active item is filled with brand green and follows the section in view; on `/work/*` pages, Work is active.
- Right: a black "Say hello" button (mailto) and a LinkedIn button.
- On scroll, the name and buttons fade out and only the pill stays sticky, with a shadow.

**Home page** sections:
- Hero: gradient H1, company chips, and a fan of 4 tilted hero cards. The video card has a focus/blur hover, a play button and a Caveat annotation.
- Case studies: compact cards, text on the left (`1.5fr`) and thumbnail on the right (`1fr`). Order: Deep Research first, then BiWaze Vent, Arc Connect, then the rest. The whole card opens the case study (a stretched link under the content; the logo links and button stay clickable on their own); cards without a page aren't clickable. ABM cards show the ABM logo plus "abmrc.com ↗". Deep Research shows the Scinode | Deep Research logo (`public/logos/scinode-deep-research.svg`, from Sathi) with no link, since there is no public URL yet (add `logo.href` when there is).
- Case studies are followed by About as an opening journal (`journal.tsx`, `AboutJournal` in `about.tsx`, id `about`): a green notebook (coded collage cover: stamps with her photo, waves, coffee, palette, gold wax seal, barcode "sathi", ribbon) that, on scroll into view, swings open (cover's back face is blank paper), flips 3 blank pages fast over the left page, then a flat left page takes over and everything is "stuck on" one piece at a time, left page then right (`.jr-pop` in `globals.css`, staggered via `--d`, toggled by `data-reveal`). Left: name, Product Designer, circled "9+ years" (résumé), experience list, "Today" note, taped contact card, handwritten line. Scrapbook style: handwritten (Caveat) headings on paper luggage tags. Right: taped polaroid of `public/about/sathi-journal.jpg` with an Instagram sticker (tooltip = `profile.instagramHandle`, link = `profile.links.instagram`, both empty until she provides them); photo centred on the right page; four sticker clusters in the corners, overlapping a little at random angles: "my daily tools" (pixel creature with heart = Claude Code mascot `stickers/pixel-heart.png`, coded GitHub mark, coded Figma logo), "I love coffee" (`stickers/coffee.png`), "lifestyle" (`stickers/swimming.png`), "hobby" (coded painting palette); white die-cut edges, drop shadows, handwritten captions. Her palette sticker had a shop watermark (@shopemilym) and the Figma image a stock watermark, so both are coded instead; licences of the coffee, swimmer and pixel images are unconfirmed. Content in `journal` in `content.ts`. From md up it animates (cqw units); phones get the two pages stacked via a 200%-wide container so cqw sizes match. Reduced motion starts open. The journal sits on a full-width band of white handmade paper with torn top and bottom edges and a white fibrous rim (`torn-paper.tsx`: seeded SVG masks + SVG noise grain), with extra spacing above and below.
- Then Principles (`principles.tsx`, id `principles`, content `principles` in `content.ts`): a lavender #B79CEC rounded board (her purple; text in #2B2150 and #4A307D because white is unreadable on it), Caveat title "Principles that guide my work" with a deep purple underline that draws in, four huge uppercase Bricolage lines (Business first, Research based, System thinking, Impact driven) rising in one by one. Hover (mouse), tap (touch) or focus (keyboard) a line: it slides right, a coded pen-nib pointer slides in, the others dim, and three handwritten deep purple pointers appear beside it (below it on phones). Coded doodles underneath. Layout inspired by a reference site Sathi shared; the four principles and pointers are her choice.
- Then "What it's like to work with me" (`testimonials.tsx`, id `kind-words`, content `workingWithMe` in `content.ts`): a white/75 panel with a pinboard collage (xl+) of coded LinkedIn-style recommendation cards (initials avatar, name, headline, date · relation, LinkedIn mark, coloured 3px border per tone), her taped polaroid (headshot `public/sathi.jpg`, same as the header photo; always the top layer of the collage) and a yellow sticky note, all tilted; hover straightens and lifts a piece; below xl the cards stack (photo and note hidden). Layout inspired by the benshih.design testimonial collage, rebuilt in code with our own text. `status: "sample"` = placeholder person and text ("Sample" tag, "Name Surname"); `status: "draft"` = real person but text drafted by Claude for them to approve ("Draft" tag). Card 1 is Narayanan Krishnamurthy (her manager at ABM Respiratory Care; headline and photo `public/recommendations/narayanan-krishnamurthy.jpg` from his LinkedIn screenshot she shared), short two-sentence draft (clear, structured thinking; HIPAA, FDA human factors, IEC 62366), awaiting his approval. Card 2 is Leah Noaeill (US-based Global Healthcare Executive at ABM, different team; she gathered US market feedback on Sathi's designs because Sathi had no direct US access; photo `public/recommendations/leah-noaeill.jpg` from her LinkedIn screenshot), short two-sentence draft (US customer feedback, creative, on time, portal, dashboard, mobile app), awaiting her approval. Cards 3–5 are samples. Never remove a tag until the real, approved recommendation text replaces the draft.
- Then Contact, Footer. Experience ("Where I've designed") and Skills ("How I work") were removed from the page at her request; the components are kept but not rendered. The old About card is kept in `about.tsx` but not rendered.

## Content rules (important)
- **Keep everything authentic.** Never invent metrics, quotes, research or team details. If something is missing, leave a clearly marked placeholder and ask me.
- BiWaze Vent uses my résumé metrics: ~30% fewer errors, ~20% higher engagement, ~25% less dev time, 100% on-time delivery.
- Arc Connect has no published outcome metrics. It shows "Project at a glance" scope facts instead: 35 screens, 4 core areas, 14-day adherence history, 2 care settings.
- Prefer coded visuals (SVG/HTML) over screenshots. Code the text in presentation boards as real text; keep only the phone screens and illustrations as images.
- Use free-licence images only (Unsplash/Pexels), never random Google images.
- My contact details:
  - Email: virgosathi71@gmail.com
  - LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/sathimidya
  - Behance: https://behance.net/virgosathi0041
  - The résumé PDF in `public/` is intentionally published, including my phone number.

## Architecture
- `src/lib/content.ts`: all home page copy, including profile, nav, hero cards, case study cards, experience, skills and testimonials.
- `src/lib/case-studies/types.ts`: the `CaseStudy` type and a `Block` union. Each case study is a list of sections made of typed blocks.
- Block types:
  - Text: `p`, `lead`, `h3`, `list`, `cards`, `chips`
  - Images and diagrams: `figure`, `problemVisual`, `diagram`, `illustrations`
  - Research: `findings`, `interviews`, `quotes`, `perspective`, `personas`, `quadrants`
  - Process and systems: `phases`, `visualSystem`, `designSystem`
  - Mobile and motion: `phoneFlow`, `video`, `showcase`, `homeBoard`
  - Added for Deep Research (generic, reusable): `flow`, `principle`, `shift`, `insights`, `journey`, `tree`, `media` (real screenshots and demo clips in a browser frame with a soft layered shadow, straight on the page background, no container, extra top spacing when it carries a section heading; always one per row at full width; videos are click-to-play, never autoplay; optional `note` = a taped, tilted yellow sticky note with the section's pointers above the first item at the right, overlapping only its top bars (browser bar + app header), each note a different pastel; the section `heading` + `intro` sit beside the note on the left (stacked on phones)), `kioskStage` (huge faint beige title on the page background, partly hidden behind a coded, tilted touchscreen monitor on a stand; optional `notes` groups (Home screen, Ask in your own words) form a panel overlapping its bottom edge; the screen is a real screenshot; style from a Behance reference, rebuilt in code because that image isn't free to use), `specs`, `typeHierarchy`, `palette` (rendered as a colour stage), `problemSolution`, `steps`, `stats` (big-number cards, real figures only), `markedImage` (notebook-style pen circles, arrows and handwritten notes over an image, in image coordinates), `lessons` (big faint numerals, divider, no cards), `finale` (closing lines in ink/green/purple + handwritten sign-off), `pegboard` (pinned sketches with tilts, push pins and handwritten tags), `cycle` (presentation-board loop: huge faint numerals, pastel icon discs, dotted connectors and a handwritten return arc; last title in brand green), `lead.emphasis` (editorial statement with a green second sentence), `h3.spaced`; `personas` also accepts `about`, `facts`, `needs`, `quote` for a rich single-persona card
- `src/lib/case-studies/*.ts` hold the case study data files; register new ones in `index.ts`.
- Page template: `src/app/work/[slug]/page.tsx`. It shows:
  - Header meta: overview, role, team, timeline
  - Hero image (`object-contain` 16/9 when `background: "transparent"`)
  - Impact metrics (compact 2×2 cards with a pointer line)
  - A sticky table of contents with scrollspy
  - Sections, then "More work" (cards plus a gradient "Let's talk" banner with brand icons)
- `src/components/case-study/` holds the block renderers:
  - `blocks.tsx`: the switch
  - `impact-metrics.tsx`, `toc.tsx`, `research-blocks.tsx`, `process-timeline.tsx`, `more-work.tsx`
  - `ventilator-problem-visual.tsx`: coded SVG
  - `arc-user-flow.tsx`: coded SVG flowchart with scalloped "burst" nodes, colour-coded by area, and dashed shortcuts
  - `design-system.tsx`: typography, colour capsules with photos, and Lucide icon grid
  - `mobile-blocks.tsx`: PhoneFlowView, VideoView, ShowcaseView, HomeBoardView
  - `deep-research/`: `blocks.tsx` (the new block renderers), `media.tsx` + `demo-video.tsx` (screenshots open full size; clips are click-to-play with a large Play button, pause when scrolled away, MP4 with a WebM fallback), `diagrams.tsx` (core research flow lanes), `fonts.ts` (Inter), `showcase.tsx` (reference-board styles: problem/solution split, pill-and-connector user flow `dr-journey-map`, colour stage)
  - `loop-video.tsx`: client component that sets `muted` and calls `play()`, because React doesn't SSR `muted`; it respects reduced motion

## Case studies so far
1. **BiWaze Vent** (`/work/biwaze-vent`), a ventilator UI for ABM Respiratory Care. Source: https://www.behance.net/gallery/188179087/
   - It covers: problem visual, interviews (participant summary only), staggered serif quotes, a findings bento (separators only, no containers), and a process timeline on the page background (3 months / 64 hours / 70+ screens).
2. **Arc Connect lung health app** (`/work/arc-connect-app`). Source: https://www.behance.net/gallery/174251777/
   - Sections:
     - Context: acute and home care
     - Structure: coded user flow
     - Design system: Roboto; brand Green `#A9D158`, Blue `#3798BF`, Sky `#6CE3FF`, Orange `#F26930`; neutrals
     - Screens: see the list below
     - Outcome
   - Screens:
     - The onboarding `showcase`: the original Behance animation upscaled 2×, on a `#2d2d2d` container that matches how Chrome renders the video's background, with feathered edges. The "Authentication" label, the large faint "Onboarding" word and the paragraph are coded.
     - Phone flows: sign-up/login, device registration, home and adherence.
     - The Home `homeBoard`: a 2× phone recording on a white card, with coded "Home", "We care for you", subtitle and paragraph. The illustration is the original 600px Behance asset.
     - Therapy goals, invitations and connections, and Profile (Edit profile, Personal info, Medical condition, Settings).
3. **SCINODE Deep Research** (`/work/deep-research`), Scimplify, 0 → 1 AI research workspace for chemists. Source: Sathi's own write-up (Oct 2026).
   - Condensed (Oct 2026) at Sathi's request: short, simple words, framed as "Designing a GenAI product"; never write "0 → 1", use "new product", "built from the ground up" or "concept to launch", sections in order: Overview, Problem, Research (ends with an h3 "Persona" above the persona board), Empathy map (`empathyMap`: says/thinks/does/feels on a dashed cross around Prem's portrait, plus pains/gains, derived from the write-up and persona), Journey & flow, Ideation (pegboard of 9 notebook pages in a uniform 3×3 grid, 3:4 tiles cropped from the top, incl. chemist feedback and an A/B test of new vs old UI, `sketches/idea-*.jpg`, cropped and enhanced: paper whitened by dividing out the background, ink saturated and sharpened), Typography & colour, Key decisions (7), Launch week, Learnings (Outcome section deleted as repetitive; Learnings trimmed to 2 `lessons` + a `finale` statement with a handwritten "Thanks for reading", no cards). Launch week: (30 Sep – 6 Oct 2026: 18 active users, 29 research threads, 13 users researched a molecule. Sathi does NOT want cost, tokens, model calls or waste shown. `launch-dash-marked.jpg` is her dashboard with everything blurred except Users, Threads and Molecules per user (cost hints and the email table blurred too), shown via `markedImage` with red pen circles, yellow curvy arrows and handwritten notes; never use the unblurred original). Keep it scannable; don't re-add long lists.
   - Visual style follows her reference boards, but every board sits on the page background (no lavender stages or tinted containers): large light headings, pill nodes, rounded colour squares. Reference charts with percentages (validation, sentiment, usability groups) are NOT used until she provides real results.
   - Real product media only (never recreate product UI): from Sathi's walkthrough video (5:12, 1080p). The source video has non-square pixels (SAR 1629:1384): always extract with `scale=trunc(iw*sar/2)*2:ih,setsar=1`, giving 2258×1080 stills and 1600×766 clips (H.264 CRF 25 + VP9 WebM, muted, waits sped up, posters `*-poster-v2.jpg` at 35%). Sathi prefers one video per feature over screenshot + video. Removed at her request: My Repository video, route analysis screenshot, new-variant video.
   - `screens/home-light.jpg` (true aspect, 16:10 crop) is shown in the section 1 kiosk mockup.
   - Hero `hero-lab.jpg`: Sathi's lab stock photo with the Modify Path screenshot perspective-warped onto the green screen (OpenCV); glass tubes in front are kept by chroma-keying only the bottom-left. Also used as the home card and link preview image.
   - Purple for this case study is #B79CEC (Sathi), set via `accent` on the CaseStudy: it overrides --tone-purple on <main>, with --tone-purple-ink #6B4CB8 for text on cream and --on-purple #2B2150 for text on purple fills (white on #B79CEC is unreadable). Palette: deep green #1F392D, purple #4A307D, lavender #B79CEC, warm white #FCFAF6.
   - Persona: Prem Kumar, Senior Scientist at Scimplify, 16–20 years, AI confidence Medium–High. `personas.layout: "board"` renders `persona-board.tsx`: an illustrated desk scene (face crop `persona-prem-face.jpg` in a dashed AI halo with sparkles, speech-bubble quote, name plate on a line-drawn desk with flask, papers, mug and laptop, handwritten blue notes with dotted leaders for experience, AI confidence meter, goals, frustrations and needs). Phones show the rich card instead.
   - Key decisions follow Sathi's product slides: 1 Home + Ask (kiosk), 2 The agent gets to work, 3 Every route ranked and diagrammed, 4 Edit the route, 5 From mmol to batch quantities, 6 Every route traced to its evidence, 7 A research partner that gets better as you work.
   - No adoption metrics: "Project at a glance" shows scope facts (0 → 1, 8 stages, 9 screens, UX → code).
- Card for **Arc Connect Web Portal** links to Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/181423391/Arc-Connect-Web-Portal

## Asset pipeline (how existing assets were made)
- **Tools:** Python with PIL and OpenCV, and ffmpeg. Everything goes in `public/case-studies/<slug>/`.
- **Phone screens:**
  - Cut from the Behance boards at 560px wide, as RGBA PNGs with transparency outside the phone.
  - Orange presentation arrows are removed with OpenCV inpainting.
  - Text the arrows covered is redrawn in Roboto.
  - The bezel and header can be copied from a clean phone, since all phones share the same frame.
- **GIFs to MP4:**
  - Crop, then denoise only the colourful areas (median + NL-means masked by saturation) so text stays sharp.
  - Upscale 2× with Lanczos and a mild unsharp mask.
  - Encode H.264 with bt709 tags (`yuv420p`, `+faststart`).
- **Overwritten files:** after overwriting an image under the same name, rename it, because the Next image cache serves stale versions.

## Open items (ask me)
- Real LinkedIn recommendations (name, headline, relation, date, text) to replace the 3 samples in `workingWithMe`, and Narayanan's and Leah's approval (or their posted text and dates) for the drafts on cards 1 and 2
- Instagram URL and handle (`profile.links.instagram`, `profile.instagramHandle` in `content.ts`), shown on the journal sticker
- BiWaze: per-role interview counts, US marketing team feedback, and confirmation of team, year and "64 hours"
- Public link for SCINODE Deep Research (for the logo on its home card)
- Deep Research: confirm the sampled palette, the year/duration, and any real validation or usability results (would unlock the reference-style insight charts). The video doesn't show the Scale/target-quantity input or Optimization (marked "coming soon").
- Role title: Deep Research says "Senior Product Designer", the Experience section says "Product Designer" at Scimplify. Confirm which is right.
- An original high-resolution export (Lottie/After Effects/MP4) of the Arc Connect logo animation, to replace the upscaled GIF
- I must delete the empty repo `sathi-design/portfolio-website` myself.

## How to work with me
- Make small, verified changes. After each change, check the page in the browser at desktop and phone width, then commit and push to `main` with a clear message.
- When I send a screenshot reference, match its layout and interaction closely, but use my content.
- Give a short summary after each change: what changed, what I should look at, and anything you couldn't do.
- End every reply with this line (Windows PowerShell, so I can pull and run the latest version):
  ```
  cd $HOME\Desktop\portfolio-website; git pull; npm.cmd run dev
  ```
